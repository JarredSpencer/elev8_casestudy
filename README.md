Adam was a banker for 23 years doing finance and technology building for Chase and BBVA, he left banking to focus on those things in payments to sell to banks and became a natural conduit to facilitate transactions as a consulting advisor. The advisement group was 100% bootstrapped and did not receive any funding from outside sources. Their main objective is to provide solutions for distribution, access to technology, economy of scale, and competitive pricing for small to medium sized businesses and banks. elev8 accomplishes this by increasing their receivables through payment acceptance (all types) also targeting large enterprise merchants who generally have larger barriers of entry due to complexity and size/ scope of work needed to execute that change. elev8 offers what they call “ The collective” in order to solve these problems. “The team is changing the perceptions of consulting from episodic engagements to long-term strategic partnerships. elev8 collaborates and advises the industry’s boldest creators of big ideas. We help guide those innovations into becoming products or practices, therefore assisting to create the newest trends currently disrupting the payments ecosystem.
